This is a project that I'm using as a final project for CSCI - 551 Numerical and Parallel programming.

This uses 3 independent methods of parallelizing in combination with a Reimann sum integration estimation to measure the efficacy of the parallel methods.

The methods of parallelization are:
  * MPI
  * OpenMP
  * Pthreads

Also inclused are two Hybrid versions:
  * MPI with OpenMP
  * MPI with Pthreads

All output is generated from my i5-7200U laptop running Ubuntu. Since this is a 4 core system with hyperthreading, I only tested with up to 8 total processes/threads

Note: the Hybrid methods were tested using a cluster available at CSU, Chico

All code was written and generated by myself, and anyone is welcome to use it without referencing me so long as it's not for heinous purposes within the same class I'm writing this for.
